## About Me

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). I am also the co-founder of [BITS (Singapore)](https://www.better-iot.com.sg/), a company focused on intelligent IoT solutions.
I received my Ph.D. in 2023 from the [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), NTU, under the supervision of [Professor Mo Li](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~lim/). Earlier, I earned my B.E. degree in 2017 from the [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](https://www.hit.edu.cn/).

<!-- My research focuses on intelligent localization and sensing systems based on wireless signals. By leveraging ubiquitous ambient signals—including multi-protocol radio (e.g., Wi-Fi, UWB) and acoustic waves—I develop methods to observe and interpret environmental dynamics. My work combines advanced signal processing with AI-driven algorithms to extract precise location and state information of target objects, followed by real-world system implementation and validation.
Additionally, I explore the evolution of IoT technologies (e.g., LoRaWAN, Sparklink) for industrial applications, with a focus on enhancing network reliability and tailoring Quality of Service (QoS) to meet the demands of complex industrial environments. -->

My research focuses on intelligent localization and sensing using wireless signals. By leveraging ambient signals—including multi-protocol radio (e.g., Wi-Fi, UWB) and acoustic waves—I develop methods to perceive and interpret environmental dynamics. My work combines signal processing and AI algorithms to extract precise location and state information, followed by prototype development and real-world validation. I also investigate emerging IoT technologies (e.g., LoRaWAN, Sparklink), with a focus on improving network reliability and capacity, as well as customizing QoS to meet practical industrial needs.

## Research Interests

- **Wireless sensing:** Localization and tracking, vital signal monitroing, recognition and identification
- **IoT communication:** High reliability, Dynamic QoS
<!-- - **Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS):** Antenna design and system optimization -->
