## About Me

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). I also worked as the AIoT scientist at [BITS Pte. Ltd. (Singapore)](https://www.better-iot.com.sg/), a startup focused on intelligent IoT solutions.
I received my Ph.D. in 2023 from the [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), NTU, under the supervision of [Professor Mo Li](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~lim/). Earlier, I earned my B.E. degree in 2017 from the [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](https://www.hit.edu.cn/).

<!-- My research focuses on intelligent localization and sensing systems based on wireless signals. By leveraging ubiquitous ambient signals—including multi-protocol radio (e.g., Wi-Fi, UWB) and acoustic waves—I develop methods to observe and interpret environmental dynamics. My work combines advanced signal processing with AI-driven algorithms to extract precise location and state information of target objects, followed by real-world system implementation and validation.
Additionally, I explore the evolution of IoT technologies (e.g., LoRaWAN, Sparklink) for industrial applications, with a focus on enhancing network reliability and tailoring Quality of Service (QoS) to meet the demands of complex industrial environments. -->
